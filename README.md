# programs.sqlite for Nix Flake based systems

[![Update Channel Info](https://github.com/wamserma/flake-programs-sqlite/actions/workflows/scrape.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/wamserma/flake-programs-sqlite/actions/workflows/scrape.yml)

## TL;DR

(assuming a flake similar to <https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Using_nix_flakes_with_NixOS>)

Add to `inputs` in `flake.nix`:

```nix
flake-programs-sqlite.url = "github:wamserma/flake-programs-sqlite";
flake-programs-sqlite.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
```

Then just add the module.

### NixOS module

Usage with a minimal system flake:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-22.11;
  inputs.flake-programs-sqlite.url = "github:wamserma/flake-programs-sqlite";
  inputs.flake-programs-sqlite.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  outputs = inputs@{ self, nixpkgs, ... }: {

    nixosConfigurations.mymachine = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules =
        [
          (import configuration.nix)
          inputs.flake-programs-sqlite.nixosModules.programs-sqlite
        ];
    };
  };
}
```

The module's functionality is enabled as soon as the module is imported.

### alternative: without using a module

Add `flake-programs-sqlite` to the arguments of the flake's `outputs` function.

Add `programs-sqlite-db = flake-programs-sqlite.packages.${system}.programs-sqlite`
to the `specialArgs` argument of `lib.nixosSystem`.

Add `programs-sqlite-db`to the inputs of your system configuration (`configuration.nix`)
and to the configuration itself add:

```nix
programs.command-not-found.dbPath = programs-sqlite-db;
```

## Why?

NixOS systems configured with flakes and thus lacking channels usually have a broken
`command-not-found`. The reason is that the backing database `programs.sqlite` is only
available on channels. The problem is that the channel URL can not be determined from
the `nixpkgs` revision alone, as it also contains a build number.

<details>
  <summary>
  <code>command-not-what?</code>
  </summary>

  Bash and other shells have a special handler that is invoked when an unknown command
  is issued to the shell. For bash this is `command_not_found_handler`.

  `command-not-found` is [a Perl script](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/7c44c865ee736afba33ee8788b59e4a123800437/nixos/modules/programs/command-not-found/command-not-found.pl)
  that is hooked into this handler when
  the option [`programs.command-not-found.enable`](https://search.nixos.org/options?show=programs.command-not-found.enable)
  is set to `true`. This perl script evaluates a pre-made database to suggest
  packages that might be able to provide the command.

  The pre-made database is generated as part of a channel, hence pure-flake-systems
  do not have access to it. This flake extracts the database from the channels
  and passes it to the `command-not-found` script to restore functionality that
  was previously only available when using channels.
</details>

This is an attempt to provide a usable solution, motivated by <https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-specify-programs-sqlite-for-command-not-found-from-flakes/22722/3>

## How?

The channel page is regularly scraped for the revision and file hashes, then a
[lookup table](./sources.json) from revisions to URL and hashes is amended with any
new information.
The lookup table is used to create a fixed-output-derivation (FOD) for `programs.sqlite`
based on the revision of `nixpkgs` passed as input of this flake.

## Usage

see TL:DR above

## Development

The flake provides a minimal devshell, but hacking on the code with a editor and
running `nix run .#updater` is valid, too.

Development happens on the `tooling` branch, which is then merged into the `main`
branch. Updates to the JSON file go directly to `main`. Releases of the tooling are
also cut from the `tooling` branch. There are no releases for the JSON files.

## Fetching selected channel revisions

e.g. to fetch info for older revisions/releases from before this project was started

```sh
[ -f sources.json ] || echo {} > sources.json
nix run github:wamserma/flake-programs-sqlite#updater -- --dir:. --channel:https://releases.nixos.org/nixos/20.03/nixos-20.03.2400.ff1b66eaea4
```

Multiple channels/revisions may be passed for a single run.  
If no channel is given, the current channels are guessed and their latest revisions are fetched.
